# Py-Bot

To use the Python chatbot I provided in the previous response, you can follow these steps:

## Install the Required Libraries:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it's not already installed. Then, open your command prompt or terminal and use pip to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install chatterbot chatterbot_corpus
```

**Create a Python File:**
Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new Python file, e.g., 
```bash
chatbot.py.
```
**Copy the Chatbot Code:**
Copy the Python chatbot code I provided in the previous response and paste it into your *chatbot.py* file.

**Run the Chatbot:**
Save the chatbot.py file and run it using the command prompt or terminal:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## Interact with the Chatbot:
Once the chatbot is running, it will greet you with "Hello! How can I assist you today?" You can type your questions or messages, and the chatbot will respond based on its training data.

## Exit the Chatbot:
To exit the chatbot, simply type **"exit"** when prompted, and it will respond with **"Goodbye!"**.

You can continue to interact with the chatbot by typing questions or statements, and it will provide responses based on the pre-trained data from the ChatterBot corpus. You can also customize and extend the chatbot's capabilities by training it on your own data or by integrating it with other APIs and services.
